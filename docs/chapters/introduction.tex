\chapter{Introduction}

The report structure follows closely the project's one and focuses on the most important developing phases. After reporting the complete description of the \fwap grammar and a brief summary about the tools used for generating the tokenizer, the parser and the type-checker (see Chapter~\ref{chapter2}), a recapitulation about the chosen intermediate representation (see Chapter~\ref{chapter3}) is offered. Then, the language interpreter (see Chapter~\ref{chapter4}) and the \fsharp compiler (see Chapter~\ref{chapter5}) are reviewed. To conclude, Chapter~\ref{chapter6} and ~\ref{chapter7} are an overview of the testing phase and a quick user guide respectively.
