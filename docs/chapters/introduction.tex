\chapter{Introduction}

\fwap is a modern domain specific programming language (DSL) that has an imperative structure, with parallel execution support and higher order functions \cite{exercise}. 

The developing team working at project was structured as an Agile one, with three collaborating, self-organizing teams working to the implementation of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the parser/tokenizer module with Coco/R
	\item the interpreter, written in C\texttt{#}
	\item the \fsharp compiler, also written in C\texttt{#}
\end{enumerate}
respectively. 

Eventually, the whole group worked together to the server performing the distributed tasks and to the online version of the compiler and the interpreter, available on GitHub \cite{proj}.
