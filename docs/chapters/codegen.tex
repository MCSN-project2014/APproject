\chapter{\label{chapter4} The \fsharp Code Generator}

The code generator module is responsible of translating the \fwap intermediate representation (AST) into compilable \fsharp programs. The module itself can be thought of as a fully working \textit{compiler} (i.e. a computer program performing a translation from a source into another target language, \cite{dragon}). The executable for this piece of software is contained within the release file \textit{funwapc.exe}. 

During this chapter, we will go through the organization of the \texttt{FSCodeGen.cs} class, in which the whole translator has been implemented.
