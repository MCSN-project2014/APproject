\chapter{\label{chapter6} The System Testing}

The code testing has been conducted during the entire development of the project. During the last weeks the system has been tested on the whole, therefore a proper set of \fwap programs has been written and collected within the folder \textsl{Code_funW@P}. 

Here is the list of the tests and what aspects of the project they are checking:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{helloWorld.fun}, it is the classiv test function for any language all over the world
	\item \textit{anonymousClosureText.fun}, it is the example for function closure reported in the text of the assignment \cite{exercise}
	\item \textit{anonymousFuncs.fun}, yet another test for closures of anonymous function which defines a tick() counter
	\item \textit{anonymousFunctionClosure.fun}, the last anonymous functions test
	\item \textit{boolReduceAsync.fun}, it asynchronously computes the maximum among five numbers according to a reduce pattern
	\item \textit{bracket.fun}, it tests bracketed expressions only
	\item \textit{ECTS.fun}, it is a test for nested if's but is also a useful program converting university grades from the italian system into the European Credit Transfer System \cite{ects}
\end{itemize}
