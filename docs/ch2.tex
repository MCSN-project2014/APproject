\chapter{\label{chapter2} Designing the Language}

The grammar design has been a complex, delicate and continuous task of the project, since the grammar represents the true definition of a language in formal terms and it revealed to be of crucial importance for all the subsequent phases. Lots of on the fly adjustments and corrections leaded to the definition reported in the following section.

\section{EBNF Grammar}

The whole grammar is described by means of the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF, \cite{ebnf}) which is metasyntax, commonly adopted by parser generators nowadays. We first introduce the used tokens, which are the following ones:

\begin{lstlisting}
TOKENS
ident  = letter {letter | digit}.
url = ap "http://" {UrlInLine} ap.
number = digit {digit}.
string = '"' {AnyButDoubleQuote | "\\\""} '"'.
\end{lstlisting}

Then we provide all the needed productions:
