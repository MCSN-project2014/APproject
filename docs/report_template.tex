The aim of this report is to offer an overview of the  \fwap  implementation and of the main design choices, made during its development. Also, it is intended both as a synthetic reference and a manual for the user wishing to use or extend our simple language.

Since an actual printed document may seem an old-fashioned tool to the modern reader, all the information provided here will be also available at the official Wiki of the project on \href{https://github.com/MCSN-project2014/APproject}{GitHub}\cite{proj}.
