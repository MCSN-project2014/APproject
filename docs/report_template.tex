\begin{abstract}

The aim of this report is to offer an overview of the  \fwap  implementation and of the main design choices made during its development. Also, this document is intended both as a reference and a manual for the user wishing to use or extend our simple language. 

All the information provided here will also be available at the official page of the project on GitHub \href{https://github.com/MCSN-project2014/APproject}{(https://github.com/MCSN-project2014/APproject)}.

%%% Introduction

\chapter{Introduction}

The report structure follows closely the project's one and focuses on the most important developing phases. After reporting the complete description of the \fwap grammar and a brief summary about the tools used for generating the tokenizer, the parser and the type-checker (see Chapter~\ref{chapter2}), a recapitulation about the chosen intermediate representation (see Chapter~\ref{chapter3}) is offered. Then, the \fsharp code generator (see Chapter~\ref{chapter4}) and the language interpreter (see Chapter~\ref{chapter5}) are reviewed. To conclude, Chapter~\ref{chapter6} and ~\ref{chapter7} are an overview of the testing phase and a quick user guide respectively.
