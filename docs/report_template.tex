\fwap has been developed as the Final Project for the first year's Advanced Programming module of the MSc in Computer Science and Networking, jointly offered by the University of Pisa and the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna. The aim of this report is to offer an overview of the  \fwap language implementation and of the main design choices, made during its development. Also, it is intended both as a synthetic reference and a manual for the user wishing to use or extend our simple language.

The document structure closely follows the project's one and focuses on the most important developing phases. After reporting the complete description of the \fwap grammar and a brief summary about the tools used for generating the tokenizer, the parser and the type-checker (see Chapter~\ref{chapter2}), a recapitulation about the chosen intermediate representation (see Chapter~\ref{chapter3}) is offered. Then, the language interpreter (see Chapter~\ref{chapter4}) and the \fsharp compiler (see Chapter~\ref{chapter5}) are reviewed. To conclude, Chapter~\ref{chapter6} and ~\ref{chapter7} are an overview of the testing phase and a quick user guide respectively\footnote{Since an actual printed document may seem an old-fashioned tool to the modern reader, all the information provided here will be soon available at the official Wiki of the project on \href{https://github.com/MCSN-project2014/APproject}{GitHub}\cite{proj}.}.
